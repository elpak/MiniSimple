###Install Ckeditor plugin for flatpress
1. You need to edit this file:
Admin/panels/static/admin.static.write.tpl

2. Find the line with:
{*here will go a plugin hook*}

3. And then write:
{action hook=simple_edit_form}

4. Is Ckeditor compatible with bbcode? Yes. You can use both at same time. 
However, I recommend to use only one at the same time.

How to install the plugin:
1. Download the plugin from https://themes.blog7.org/mini/index.html or from https://wiki.flatpress.org/res:themes
2. Create a new folder and name it ckeditor.
3. Extract the theme inside your ckeditor folder. 
4. Upload the ckeditor folder to your FlatPress blog's plugins folders 
(*yourblog.com/fp-plugins/*).
5. Enable the Ckeditor plugin in your AdminCP's plugins section. 

###Fix the PrettyURLs .hataccess
1. If the PrettyURLs plugin is enabled, you need go to PrettyURLs Config in your 
AdminCP's plugins section/menu and bellow this line:

RewriteBase /blog/

2. You need write:

RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]

###Custom Favicon
Your file *must* be named favicon.ico and 
be a ICO file (not a renamed png, jpg, gif, etc...)
or it won't work in IE
1. Upload your favicon.ico to your FlatPress blog's plugins folders -> 
favicon -> imgs
(*yourblog.com/fp-plugins/favicon/imgs*).

###Tag Plugin
The plugin adds by default the tag list in the bottom of every entry - but you 
can disable this. It also makes available a widget with tag cloud, and itâ€™s 
compatible with PrettyURLs.
